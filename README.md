# Spotify-Clone
Inspired by CWH's Web Development Project, using HTML, CSS and JS to make a clone of the website open.spotify.com

**Version: 1.0.0**

## How to Use ##
The songs are actually stored inside the songs folder, which in turn stores playlists. To implement it on your own, clone this website, and use "localhost:3000" or "127.0.0.1:3000".
Then, you can add/remove folders inside the **songs** folder. The folders are automatically used as playlists inside the program.
